# Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) project conducted by Eve Chen. The project's primary objective is to apply MDS techniques to generate low-dimensional representations (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D models) of a selected group of objects, while preserving the original inter-object distance relations.

## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on dataset number 29, which deals with mutation distances between various species. The dataset includes 20 distinct species and details their mutation distances concerning other species.

## Key Findings

- The project includes visualizations of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D models, with an analysis of the eigenvalue plots and goodness-of-fit values.
- A comparison is made between models that include all 20 species, models with 17 species (excluding extreme outliers), and models with 13 species (focusing on categories of species such as mammals, birds, cold-blooded animals, and insects).
- The findings suggest that the dimensions of the model represent categories of species, and that the number of dimensions required for a good model fit decreases when specific species are excluded.

## Usage

You can use the provided source code and data to replicate the MDS analysis and explore how different dimensionality and data filtering impact the model's performance. Feel free to adapt and extend the project for your own research or analysis.
